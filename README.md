# Tableau_NY_CityBike

This dataset set contains monthly data for the past 1 year of NY CityBike system data from: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. It combines the monthly files from Oct2017 to Sep2018 including some added fields (e.g., trip duration in minutes, day of week, etc.), and removes trips that were longer than a day.

Here, I explored the following questions to create the visualizations:
1.	Total rides per month
2.	Located bike stations on the map and setup marker size based on the busyness of the stations
3.	Determined the trip counts for each days of the week and filtered by gender
4.	Determined total gender ratio for the bike riders over the year
5.	Finally, created a Dashboard setting the stations on the map as filter for all the visualizations. Once clicked on the station (circle) on the map, it updates all the visualizations based on the logistics of that specific station.
